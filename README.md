Hi Candidates,

This at-home assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to integrate backend systems with smart contracts.
The objective is to confirm your proficiency in establishing a successful connection between the backend and smart contracts.

You'll need to add a new API called (Your Name)_Test to the server/index.js file. 
This API will allow you to fetch some information from pre-deployed or public smart contracts.
There’s no need for a front-end interface; just log the results to the console to demonstrate your work.
Once you've completed the test, please share me a public repo what you've done.

Looking forward to seeing your work—give it your best!
